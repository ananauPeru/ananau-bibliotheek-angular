    <h4 class="display">Step 1 - Clone the Repo</h4>
    <p>If you’ve successfully completed the previous guides, you should have access to Añañau's GitHub repositories.
      Clone the educational app locally to a desired location on your computer. This allows you to review the
      implemented functionalities and make future changes.</p>

    <h4 class="display">Step 2 - Use the Back-End and MySQL Database</h4>
    <p>This app uses the same back-end and MySQL setup as the other previously implemented projects, so check the
      earlier guides for instructions on running them locally.</p>

    <h4 class="display">Step 3 - Make Your Changes (Best Practices)</h4>
    <h5 class="display">A - Overview of Implemented Functionalities</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Students:</strong> List-overview + Create + Delete
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Exercises:</strong> List-overview + Create + Edit + Delete
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Making exercises:</strong> A student can complete a minimum of one and a maximum of all exercises at a
        given moment. At the end of the session, the student will see how many questions they answered correctly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Results:</strong> List-overview + Delete
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="display">B - Expanding Exercises</h5>
    <p>Currently, the logic for exercises is tailored to the specific structure requested by the customer. If they wish
      to
      introduce more variables or change how exercises are modeled (e.g., more images, sounds, no option buttons,
      etc.), this can be done fairly easily.
      Exercises inherit from a parent class that contains common variables (e.g., question, ID). To implement a new type
      of exercise, create a new object that inherits from the parent and add any specific properties required.
    </p>
    <p>After updating the controller, service, and other layers to work with the new exercise via a new DTO, you’ll need
      to reflect these variables in the relevant component to ensure they’re visible on the screen.

      As a developer, you’ll likely know how to manage this process, but documenting how to expand the exercises was
      part of my task—so let’s keep it clear.

      Also, don’t hesitate to check resources like Stack Overflow, YouTube tutorials, etc.—this takes part of a
      developer's workflow.

      Good luck!</p>
