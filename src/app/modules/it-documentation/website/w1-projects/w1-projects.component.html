          In order to manage the projects we need to go to the dashboard of the WordPress website. This can be found on the following link: <a
          href="https://ananau.org/wp-admin/" target="_blank">https://ananau.org/wp-admin/</a>. Here you can log into your account. If you don't already have an account, please contact <strong>Ellen Bosh</strong> or <strong>Gilmourd Cardeña Pérez</strong>. They can create an account for you.
      </p>
      <p>
          In the sidebar on the left, you will find multiple tabs to choose from. We are interested in the <strong>Projects</strong> tab. You will be presented with a list of all the projects that are currently available on the website. This page will be the starting point for creating, updating and deleting the projects.
      </p>
      <h2 class="display">Create a project</h2>
      <p>Creating a project is really simple. First, we want to navigate to the "Add a new project" button on the top of the screen. You will be navigated into the wordpress editor, when you have used wordpress before this should look familiar. There will be a few properties that are important to fill in on this page.</p>

      <h3 class="display">Properties</h3>
      
      <h4 class="display">Page title</h4>
      <p>The page title will be used as the name of the project. It is important that you give it a recognizable name and keep it as short as possible.</p>

      <h4 class="display">Page body</h4>
      <p>In the page body you can write as much as you want about the project. You can use extra images, tables, headings, text, etc...</p>

      <h4 class="display">Project description</h4>
      <p>This is the description of the project. This should only give a short explaination about what the project is and where it stands for. It is recommended to keep this under 10 lines because this is shown next to the <a (click)="scrollToElement(displayimage)">display image</a>.</p>

      <h4 #displayimage class="display">Display image</h4>
      <p>The display image will be shown on the details page of the project. It is recommended to use a portrait oriented image for this (layout considerations).</p>

      <h4 class="display">Featured image</h4>
      <p>The featured image will be shown everywhere where the project is referenced, for example on the 'all projects page'. It is recommended to use an landscape oriented image, because it's often used as "banner".</p>

      <h4 class="display">Excerpt</h4>
      <p>An excerpt is an optional summary of the discription. This is also shown when the projects is referenced on other pages. This should be really short (10-15 words). When no excerpt is given, wordpress will create one automatically</p>

      <h3 class="display warning">Note</h3>
      <p>As the projects follow the same principles as blog posts there are a few things to keep in mind.</p>

      <ul>
          <li>You can optionally add a category to the project (this isn't showing anywhere on the website though);</li>
          <li>You can update the slug (this is the url it navigates to (eg. projects/new-project);</li>
          <li>After adding al the properties, you have to create the project for the other languages (This is possible in the right sidebar);</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="display">Result</h3>
      <p>When everything is filled in correctly and the project has been <strong>published</strong> in all the necessary languages, it will automatically apear on the website (You can check on the 'all projects' page).</p>

      <h2 class="display">Modify a project</h2>
      <p>Updating a project is even easier than creating one. On the page where all the projects are listed, you navigate to the project you want to edit and click "edit". You will be redirected to a new page with the wordpress editor. On this page you can update all the properties needed.</p>

      <h3 class="display warning">Note</h3>
      <p>Make sure to update the properties in all the available languages.</p>

      <h2 class="display">Delete a project</h2>
      <p>To delete a project, search it in the list and press "Trash". This will move the project to the trash, where it will be archived for 30 days. When you unintentionally remove a project, you can recover it in the 'trash' tab.</p>

      <h3 class="display warning">Note</h3>
      <p>Make sure to delete the project in all the available languages.</p>

      <h2 class="display">Change the order of the projects</h2>
      <p>On the 'all projects' page, the projects are shown in ascending menu order. This means that he first project in the list will be shown as the first project on the page.</p>
      <p>To change the order of the projects, you navigate to the 're-order' tab under 'Projects' in the dashboard sidebar. On this screen you have the ability to re-order the projects to the desired order.</p>
