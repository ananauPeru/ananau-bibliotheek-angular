          In order to manage the team members we need to go to the dashboard of the WordPress website. This can be found on the following link: <a
          href="https://ananau.org/wp-admin/" target="_blank">https://ananau.org/wp-admin/</a>. Here you can log into your account. If you don't already have an account, please contact <strong>Ellen Bosh</strong> or <strong>Gilmourd Cardeña Pérez</strong>. They can create an account for you.
      </p>
      <p>
          In the sidebar on the left, you will find multiple tabs to choose from. We are interested in the <strong>Team members</strong> tab. You will be presented with a list of all the team members that are currently available on the website. This page will be the starting point for creating, updating and deleting the team members.
      </p>
      <h2 class="display">Add a team member</h2>
      <p>Adding a team member is really simple. First, we want to navigate to the "Add New Member" button on the top of the screen. You will be navigated into the wordpress editor, when you have used wordpress before this should look familiar. There will be a few properties that are important to fill in on this page.</p>

      <h3 class="display">Properties</h3>
      
      <h4 class="display">Page title</h4>
      <p>The page title will be used as the name of the Team Member.</p>

      <h4 class="display">Function</h4>
      <p>Descibe the function of this team member. It's recommended to keep this as short as possible.</p>

      <h4 class="display">Education quote</h4>
      <p>The educational quote is a small text about what education means for this team member. This will be shown on the 'Our team' page.</p>

      <h4 class="display">LinkedIn</h4>
      <p>You can add the link to the team member's LinkedIn profile. This is an optional field and will not be shown on the website when left empty.</p>

      <h4 class="display">Featured image</h4>
      <p>The featured image is used as the picture of the team member.</p>

      <h3 class="display warning">Note</h3>
      <p>As the team members follow the same principles as blog posts there are a few things to keep in mind.</p>

      <ul>
          <li>You can update the slug (this is the url it navigates to (eg. /team-members/new-team-member);</li>
          <li>After adding al the properties, you have to create the team member for the other languages (This is possible in the right sidebar);</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="display">Result</h3>
      <p>When everything is filled in correctly and the team member has been <strong>published</strong> in all the necessary languages, it will automatically apear on the website (You can check on the 'Our team' page).</p>

      <h2 class="display">Update a team member</h2>
      <p>Updating a team member is even easier than adding one. On the page where all the team members are listed, you navigate to the team member you want to edit and click "edit". You will be redirected to a new page with the wordpress editor. On this page you can update all the properties needed.</p>

      <h3 class="display warning">Note</h3>
      <p>Make sure to update the properties in all the available languages.</p>

      <h2 class="display">Delete a team member</h2>
      <p>To delete a team member, search it in the list and press "Trash". This will move the team member to the trash, where it will be archived for 30 days. When you unintentionally delete a team member, you can recover it in the 'trash' tab.</p>

      <h3 class="display warning">Note</h3>
      <p>Make sure to delete the team member in all the available languages.</p>

      <h2 class="display">Change the order of the team members</h2>
      <p>On the 'our team' page, the team members are shown in ascending menu order. This means that he first team member in the list will be shown as the first team member on the page.</p>
      <p>To change the order of the team memmbers, you navigate to the 're-order' tab under 'Team members' in the dashboard sidebar. On this screen you have the ability to re-order the team members to the desired order.</p>
