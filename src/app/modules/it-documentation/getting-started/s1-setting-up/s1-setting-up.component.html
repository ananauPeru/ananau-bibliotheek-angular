            Now you have access to the resources, what's next?
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we have access we can start working for Ananau. For that, you need some programs to work efficiently. We
            strongly recommend using the advised editors because this will make your life much easier with much needed
            extensions.
        </p>
        <h4 class="display">Step 1 - Clone the Repo's</h4>

        <p>If you have successfully finished the previous guide, you should have access to the Github repo's of Ananau.
            Clone them locally to a desired place within your computer. For the purpose of this tutorial i created a new
            map called <kbd>ananau-tutorial</kbd>.</p>
        <pre>DESKTOP /ananau-tutorial<br>$ git clone https://github.com/ananauPeru/ananau-bibliotheek-angular.git<br>$ git clone https://github.com/ananauPeru/ananau-bibliotheek-api.git</pre>

        <p>If everything went correctly you should now have two directories.</p>

        <h4 class="display">Step 2 - Necessary Software</h4>

        <p>For the frontend we use <kbd>Visual Studio Code</kbd>, for the backend we use <kbd>Visual Studio
                2019</kbd> and for DB Management we use <kbd>MySQL Workbench</kbd>. The frontend is written in Angular
            11.0.9 and for the backend we use .NET Core 5.0.3</p>
        <p>So next, you need to install:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
            <li>Visual Studio 2019 (or any later version)</li>
            <li>.NET Core 5.0.x</li>
            <li>MySQL Workbench</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>Angular</li>
            <li>We trust you don't need instructions for this step... :)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="display">Step 3 - Getting the frontend ready</h4>

        <p>After you've installed all the mentioned software, let's open our frontend in vscode and run the following
            command within our directory (this can take a while, be patient):</p>

        <pre>DESKTOP /ananau-tutorial/ananau-bibliotheek-frontend<br>$ npm install</pre>

        <p>This installs all the necessary packages for the project, this step should complete without any errors. If
            you do get errors, please solve them and run it again until it finishes. The result should look something
            like this:</p>

        <img src="../../../../../assets/images/it-documentation/getting-started/s1-2.png"
            class="center-image w-75 d-block" alt="">

        <p>Now, run the following command to see if our project builds. Don't worry about the backend for now... we just
            want to see if our project builds and runs.</p>
        <pre>DESKTOP /ananau-tutorial/ananau-bibliotheek-frontend<br>$ ng serve</pre>
        <p>It should compile without issues and should be live on your localhost. The login screen should be shown like
            this:</p>

        <img src="../../../../../assets/images/it-documentation/getting-started/s1-3.png"
            class="center-image w-75 d-block" alt="">

        <p>The last step is installing some extensions for vscode to make our life (a lot) easier, not all of them are
            must-haves, the absolute necessary ones are labeled:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Azure App Service (must-have)</li>
            <li>Azure Account (must-have)</li>
            <li>Azure Resources (must-have)</li>
            <li>Angular Language Service (nice-to-have)</li>
            <li>Angular 10 Snippets (nice-to-have)</li>
            <li>Color Highlight (totally optional, highlights color codes in their color)</li>
            <li>WakaTime (totally optional but GREAT tool to track all your work, more info <a href="www.wakatime.com"
                    target="_blank">wakatime.com</a>)</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
