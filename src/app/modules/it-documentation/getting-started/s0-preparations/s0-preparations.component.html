      In order to begin working for Añañau and all of her projects we need
      access, lets sort that out first!
    </p>
    <p>
      We need access to multiple resources in order to start developing.
      Managing logins and passwords in a correct and secure manner is very
      important. So it would be a bad idea to simply list them all here. We are
      using a key vault on Azure to store all of our credentials. Below is a
      step by step instruction to access the vault and username/password
      combinations.
    </p>
    <h4 class="display">Step 1 - Log in to Azure</h4>
    <p>
      Log in to Azure and open the Añañau Resource Group named
      <kbd>ananauAPI</kbd>. If you don't have access to the Azure portal yet
      please contact <kbd>Ellen Bosh</kbd> or <kbd>Gilmourd Cardeña Pérez</kbd>.
      They can give you access to the portal, step-by-step instructions can be
      found <a (click)="scrollToElement(azureaccess)">below.</a>
    </p>

    <h5 class="display">Cannot see Añañau resources?</h5>
    <p>
      First, make sure one of the admins (Ellen or Gilmourd) has given you
      access to the resource group. If you're sure you have access but still
      cannot see the Añañau resource group, it may be because you need to switch
      directories. It is very simple, click on your profile picture located
      top-right of the screen and then click on the button
      <kbd>Switch Directory</kbd>. You'll see a list of all the resources you
      have access to. Select <kbd>Asociación ONG Añañau</kbd>.
    </p>
    <div class="w-100">
      <img
        src="../../../../../assets/images/it-documentation/getting-started/s0-6.png"
        class="center-image w-25 d-block"
        alt=""
      />
    </div>

    <h4 class="display">
      Step 2 - Give your personal Github account access to the ananauPeru repo.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Log in to Github with the IT email address of Añañau;
      <kbd>it@ananau.org</kbd>. The password for this account can be found in
      the Azure Vault; navigate to
      <kbd>Azure Añañau > ananau-master-vault > Secrets > github-it-ananau</kbd
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each repository (there are currently two active;
      <kbd>ananau-bibliotheek-angular</kbd> and
      <kbd>ananau-api-2024</kbd>) go to
      <kbd>Settings > Manage access</kbd> to add your personal (or school)
      Github account to the collaborators. Also, if there are still accounts
      from previous students who don't need access anymore (if you are sure),
      feel free to remove them.
    </p>

      class="center-image w-75"
      alt=""
    />

    <h4 class="display">Step 3 - Finishing</h4>
    <p>
      Now login to your personal Github account and make sure you have access to
      the repositories. Congrats! You now have access to all resources you need
      to start developing some really good stuff for Añañau!
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't forget, if you ever need access to a resource but don't know the
      username/password, the first place to check is the Azure Vault. If it
      isn't listed there, contact Ellen or Gilmourd.
    </p>

    <h2 #azureaccess class="display">Giving Access to New Users</h2>
    <p>
      In the past everyone logged in from the same master account with all the
      permissions for the Azure portal. This is not the best solution for
      obvious reasons. We've switched to using
      <kbd>Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)</kbd>, the official
      documentation can be found
      <a
        href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal"
        target="_blank"
        >here</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h4 class="display">Step 1 - Log in to Azure</h4>
    <p>
      Log in to Azure with the owner account
      <kbd>ellen@quebonito.onmicrosoft.com</kbd>. You will be presented with an
      overview like below, please select the resource group named
      <kbd>ananauAPI</kbd>.

      class="center-image w-75"
      alt=""
    />

    <h4 class="display">Step 2 - Navigate to Access Control (IAM)</h4>
    <p>
      Click on <kbd>Access Control (IAM)</kbd> which is located on the left
      navigation panel.
    </p>

      class="center-image w-75"
      alt=""
    />

    <h4 class="display">Step 3 - Navigate to Role Assignments Tab</h4>
    <p>
      Click on <kbd>Role Assignments (3)</kbd> which is located on the top
      navigation bar within the IAM control panel. Next click on
      <kbd>+ Add (4)</kbd> and select <kbd>Add role assignment</kbd> from the
      dropdown to assign a new role to a user.

    <h4 class="display">Step 4 - Add Role & User</h4>
    <p>
      A side-panel will show up where you need to fill in the following
      information and click on <kbd>Save</kbd>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Role: <strong><u>Añañau-Intern</u></strong> (very important to select
        the correct role, make sure you select 'Añañau-Intern')
      </li>
      <li>Assign access to: <u>User, group, or service principal</u></li>
      <li>Select: <u>example@email.com</u></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The user has been granted access to the resource group.</p>
