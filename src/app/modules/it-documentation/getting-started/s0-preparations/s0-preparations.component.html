            In order to begin working for Ananau and all of her projects we need access, lets sort that out first!
        </p>
        <p>
            We need access to multiple resources in order to start developing. Managing logins and passwords in a
            correct and secure manner is very important. So it would be a bad idea to simply list them all here. We are
            using a key vault on Azure
            to store all of our credentials. Below is a step by step instruction to access the vault and
            username/password combinations.
        </p>
        <h4 class="display">Step 1 - Log in to Azure</h4>
        <p>Log in to Azure and open the Ananau Resource Group named <kbd>ananauAPI</kbd>. If you don't have access
            to the Azure portal yet please contact <kbd>Ellen Bosh</kbd> or <kbd>Gilmourd Cardeña Pérez</kbd>. They can
            give
            you access to the portal, step-by-step instructions can be found <a (click)="scrollToElement(azureaccess)">below.</a></p>


        <h2 #azureaccess class="display">Giving Access to New Users</h2>
        <p>In the past everyone logged in from the same master account with all the permissions for the Azure portal.
            This is not the best solution for obvious reasons. We've switched to using <kbd>Azure role-based access
                control (Azure RBAC)</kbd>, the official documentation can be found <a
                href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal"
                target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <h4 class="display">Step 1 - Log in to Azure </h4>
        <p>Log in to Azure with the owner account <kbd>ellen@quebonito.onmicrosoft.com</kbd>. You will be presented with
            an overview like below, please select the resource group named <kbd>ananauAPI</kbd>.</p>

        <h4 class="display">Step 2 - Navigate to Access Control (IAM)</h4>
        <p>Click on <kbd>Access Control (IAM)</kbd> which is located on the left navigation panel.</p>
        <img src="../../../../../assets/images/it-documentation/getting-started/s0-2.png" class="center-image" alt="">
        
        <h4 class="display">Step 3 - Navigate to Role Assignments Tab</h4>
        <p>Click on <kbd>Role Assignments (3)</kbd> which is located on the top navigation bar within the IAM control panel. Next click on <kbd>+ Add (4)</kbd> and select <kbd>Add role assignment</kbd> from the dropdown to assign a new role to a user.</p>

        <h4 class="display">Step 4 - Add Role & User</h4>
        <p>A side-panel will show up where you need to fill in the following information and click on <kbd>Save</kbd>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Role: <u>contributer</u></li>
            <li>Assign access to: <u>User, group, or service principal</u></li>
            <li>Select: <u>example@email.com</u></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The user has been granted access to the resource group.</p>
