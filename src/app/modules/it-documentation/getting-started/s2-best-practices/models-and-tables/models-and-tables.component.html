            Now we have installed everything and have acces to GitHub and Azure we can finally start coding for Añañau.
            Both projects (backend & frontend) are built in a specific manner to make them stable, expandable and easy
            to deploy.
            We strongly advise you to follow these quidelines for some major tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this article we explain how our entity models can be expanded/altered and how to reflect these changes
            instantly to our DB.
        </p>

        <h5 class="display">IMPORTANT!</h5>
        <p>Use migrations cautiously. Yes, it is possible to revert or reapply migrations but it is NOT possible to get
            data that is lost.</p>
        <p>We advise to not work on the production (remote) DB but on a local DB instance. This way, you can test things
            out and apply them on the production DB when you are satisfied.</p>
        <p>Migrations make it very easy to work with multiple DB instances (test/local and production/remote). Since the
            migrations for each DB are stored and tracked by the DB itself, you can try things out on a local one and
            run them on the production one whenever you want. VS will automatically know which migrations still needs to
            be applied and execute them. Just make sure to comment/uncomment the correct connection strings when
            executing migrations.</p>

        <p>Official documentation: <a
                href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/?tabs=vs" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">.NET Core Migrations</a></p>

        <h4 class="display">Step 1 - Understanding</h4>

        <p>We are using .NET Core's built in <kbd>Migrations</kbd> feature to reflect our changes in our entities to our
            DB. It is actually very easy and straightforward. Whenever we make a change to our entities and we are
            satisfied and done, we run a simple command to update our DB accordingly.</p>

        <p>Let's give a practical example. Let's say we want to add a new property (column) named <kbd>FavoriteColor
                (string)</kbd> to our <kbd>UserDetail</kbd> entity. We start by adding the new property our model.</p>

        <img src="../../../../../assets/images/it-documentation/getting-started/s2/tables/1.png"
            class="center-image w-25 d-block" alt="">

        <h4 class="display">Step 2 - Updating our DB</h4>

        <p>If we now take a look at our DB in our <kbd>userdetails</kbd> table we will see that the new column is not
            added.</p>

        <img src="../../../../../assets/images/it-documentation/getting-started/s2/tables/2.PNG"
            class="center-image w-25 d-block" alt="">

        <p>So what's the problem? Well... we still need to reflect our changes to the DB. To do this we have to open the
            <kbd>Package Manager Console</kbd> in Visual Studio. First, we need to create a new migration with our
            changes and then update our DB with this new migration.
        </p>

        <p>Creating a new migration is done with this command, give your migration a logical name:</p>

        <pre>Package Manager Console<br>PM> EntityFrameworkCore\Add-Migration AddFavoriteColorColumnToUserDetailsTable</pre>

        <p>We don't have to specify anything. VS tracks our changes automatically and creates a migration based on the
            changes we made since our last migration. Normally, in the <kbd>Migrations</kbd> folder, our newly created
            migration should be added. Let's click on it to see the contents.</p>

        <img src="../../../../../assets/images/it-documentation/getting-started/s2/tables/3.PNG"
            class="center-image w-75 d-block" alt="">

        <p>And indeed, we see that VS automatically found the newly added property and added a migration command. If we
            look at our DB now we still won't see our column. We still need to execute one more command to push our
            changes to the DB.</p>

        <pre>Package Manager Console<br>PM> EntityFrameworkCore\Update-Database</pre>

        <p>If we look at our table now, we will see that the new column has been added.</p>

        <img src="../../../../../assets/images/it-documentation/getting-started/s2/tables/4.PNG"
            class="center-image w-25 d-block" alt="">

        <h4 class="display">Step 3 - Reverting our Changes</h4>

        <p>Let's say you've changed your mind or thought of something else... but for some reason you want to revert
            your changes. How do we do that? Again, it's very simple. Migrations are tracked in the DB and they each
            have a unique name. They can't be executed twice and they are applied in a specific order, don't forget
            this! To undo one or more migration we first need to get a list of all migrations with their unique name and
            order in our DB. To get a list of all migrations applied to our DB run the following command.</p>

        <pre>Package Manager Console<br>PM> EntityFrameworkCore\Get-Migration</pre>

        <p>It will display a list of migrations. Like this:</p>

        <img src="../../../../../assets/images/it-documentation/getting-started/s2/tables/5.PNG"
            class="center-image w-75 d-block" alt="">

        <p>Now, we simply have to copy the unique ID of the latest 'good' migration we want to revert to. In our case,
            we simply want to undo our latest migration, so I copy the ID of the previous migration. Now if I execute
            the following command with the ID of the migration I want to go back to, all migrations that come after it
            will be undone. Please be cautious, you could wipe out the entire DB if you pass in the ID of the initial
            (first) migration, double check always!</p>

        <pre>Package Manager Console<br>PM> EntityFrameworkCore\Update-Database 20210506133738_AddQuantityColumnToBooksTable</pre>

        <p>Now, we need to manually delete the migration file in our <kbd>Migrations</kbd> folder within VS and revert
            our changes on the <kbd>UserDetail</kbd> model. It is very important to not skip these steps. Otherwise,
            next time we execute a migration command they will get picked up again and executed by VS.</p>

        <p>If we look at our table in our DB we will see that the column <kbd>FavoriteColor</kbd> is removed.
            And if we again run the command <kbd>EntityFrameworkCore\Get-Migration</kbd> we'll see that the latest
            migration containing the new property is no longer there.</p>
