            If you want to upload a new lesson you can click on "Add lesson" in the menu or on the dashboard.We get a form. All fields with a red asterisk are mandatory. A (mandatory) field is only filled in correctly if we see a green check mark.
            if the subject you want is not (yet) listed, indicate “other”. Let us know so that the course can be added if necessary.

            To upload a document, click in the upload zone. You select the document you wish to upload. 
            If you want to upload multiple documents, first make a zip file of them. This is the only way you can upload multiple documents. 
            After uploading, you will see the document loading in the upload zone.
        </p>

        <p>The document is still uploading (see red text). You can only continue when the document in the upload zone is ready. If it keeps loading tap the uploaded document agian. This will allow the site to check once more whether the upload has not already been completed.</p>

            <p>You can see from the green text that the upload zone has finished loading.

                If you have filled in all the boxes correctly, the "create a new lesson" button will be enabled. Click on this button and our lesson is created.

                Do you want to add a translation to the lesson?
                We look up the lesson in our search page. We click on the edit button. (We can also change other fields here.)

                 <p>At the very bottom we see the question: "Do you want to upload a translation of the document?". We click yes. We indicate in which language the document is. We upload the document as we did with the previous upload zone. Note that the green sentence appears below the upload zone before you save the changes.</p>
